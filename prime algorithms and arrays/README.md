## üîç Detailed Algorithm Descriptions

### Prime Number Algorithms

#### AllPrimes.java - Basic Prime Generation

**Mathematical Concept:** Trial division method for primality testing

- **Algorithm**: For each number n, test divisibility by all numbers from 2 to ‚àön
- **Optimization**: Only check up to square root of the candidate number
- **Use Case**: Finding all primes up to a given limit
- **Time Complexity**: O(n‚àön) where n is the upper limit

```java
// Core logic: Test each number for primality
int divisor = 2;
while (divisor * divisor <= number && isPrime) {
    if (number % divisor == 0) {
        isPrime = false;
    }
    divisor = divisor + 1;
}
```

#### AllPrimesArray.java - Optimized Prime Generation

**Mathematical Concept:** Incremental sieve using previously found primes

- **Algorithm**: Use array of previously found primes to test new candidates
- **Optimization**: Only test divisibility against known primes (not all numbers)
- **Efficiency**: Significantly faster than basic method for large ranges
- **Space Trade-off**: Uses O(œÄ(n)) space to store primes for O(n‚àöp) time improvement

```java
// Enhanced logic: Only test against previously found primes
for(int primesIndex = 0; primesIndex < numberOfPrimes &&
    primes[primesIndex]*primes[primesIndex] <= number && isPrime;
    primesIndex = primesIndex + 1) {
    if (number % primes[primesIndex] == 0) {
        isPrime = false;
    }
}
```

### Greatest Common Divisor Algorithms

#### GCD.java - Euclidean Algorithm

**Mathematical Concept:** Based on the principle that gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a mod b)

- **Algorithm**: Repeatedly apply modular arithmetic until remainder is 0
- **Efficiency**: One of the most efficient algorithms for GCD
- **Historical**: Dates back to Euclid (~300 BCE)
- **Applications**: Cryptography, fraction simplification, number theory

```java
// Euclidean algorithm implementation
int r = m % n;
while (r != 0) {
    m = n;
    n = r;
    r = m % n;
}
// Result is in n
```

#### NaiveGCD.java - Brute Force Approach

**Mathematical Concept:** Test all possible divisors in descending order

- **Algorithm**: Start from min(a,b) and test each number until both divide evenly
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand but inefficient for large numbers
- **Comparison**: Demonstrates why Euclidean algorithm is superior
- **Educational**: Good for understanding the GCD concept

### Factorial Algorithms

#### Factorial.java - Basic Factorial Computation

**Mathematical Concept:** n! = n √ó (n-1) √ó (n-2) √ó ... √ó 1

- **Algorithm**: Iterative multiplication from 1 to n
- **Loop Structure**: While loop with accumulator pattern
- **Applications**: Combinatorics, probability, mathematical analysis
- **Limitation**: Integer overflow for large values of n

```java
// Accumulation pattern for factorial
int fact = 1;
int i = 1;
while (i <= n) {
    fact = fact * i;
    i = i + 1;
}
```

### Number Analysis Algorithms

#### FindDivisors.java - Prime Factorization

**Mathematical Concept:** Every composite number has a divisor ‚â§ ‚àön

- **Algorithm**: Find first divisor, which gives immediate factorization
- **Efficiency**: Stops at first divisor found (not all divisors)
- **Application**: Determines if number is prime or finds factor pair
- **Output**: Either declares prime or shows one factor pair

#### SpecialNumbers.java - Kaprekar Numbers

**Mathematical Concept:** Numbers where sum of split square equals original number

- **Definition**: For number n, if n¬≤ split into parts gives sum = n
- **Example**: 45¬≤ = 2025, split as 20 + 25 = 45
- **Range**: Searches numbers 32-99 (4-digit squares that split into 2-digit parts)
- **Mathematical Interest**: Demonstrates number properties and digit manipulation

```java
// Kaprekar number detection
int leftPart = (i*i)/100;     // First two digits of i¬≤
int rightPart = (i*i)%100;    // Last two digits of i¬≤
if (leftPart + rightPart == i) {
    System.out.println(i);    // Found Kaprekar number
}
```

#### Digits.java - Digit Counting

**Mathematical Concept:** Logarithmic relationship between number and digit count

- **Algorithm**: Repeatedly divide by 10 until number becomes single digit
- **Mathematical Insight**: Number of digits = floor(log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(n)) + 1
- **Applications**: Number formatting, mathematical analysis, algorithm complexity
- **Pattern**: Each division by 10 removes one digit

### Accumulation Algorithms

#### IsSumEven.java - Sum Parity Analysis

**Mathematical Concept:** Accumulation pattern with termination condition

- **Algorithm**: Read positive numbers, accumulate sum, stop on non-positive
- **Parity Check**: Determine if final sum is even or odd using modulo
