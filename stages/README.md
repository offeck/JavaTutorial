# Java Tutorial - Stages

## Overview

The **Stages** folder contains an interactive Java debugging and comprehension game designed to help students master core Java programming concepts through hands-on code analysis. Each stage focuses on specific topics and progressively builds complexity to ensure comprehensive understanding.

## Game Concept

Students are presented with Java code snippets and must predict their output. After each guess, they receive immediate feedback, the correct answer, and detailed explanations. This approach reinforces learning through:

- **Active engagement** with code rather than passive reading
- **Immediate feedback** to correct misconceptions
- **Progressive difficulty** to build confidence
- **Comprehensive explanations** to deepen understanding

## How to Use the Stages

### For Students

#### Running a Stage

1. **Compile the stage file:**

   ```powershell
   javac stage_2.java
   ```

2. **Run the stage:**

   ```powershell
   java stage_2
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use the batch file:**
   ```powershell
   play_game.bat
   ```

#### Playing Tips

- **Read carefully**: Examine each line of code methodically
- **Trace execution**: Follow the program flow step by step
- **Consider edge cases**: Think about special conditions
- **Learn from mistakes**: Review explanations for incorrect answers
- **Take notes**: Record concepts you find challenging

### For Educators

#### Creating New Stages

1. **Follow the established pattern:**

   ```java
   public class stage_X {
       private static Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
       private static int score = 0;
       private static int totalQuestions = 0;

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Stage introduction
           // Execute questions
           // Show final results
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Use the Question class for consistency:**

   ```java
   Question q1 = new Question(
       "Question Title",
       new String[]{"code", "lines", "here"},
       () -> "expected_output",
       "Educational explanation here"
   );

   q1.execute(scanner, questionNumber);
   if (q1.wasCorrect()) score++;
   ```

3. **Include comprehensive final results:**
   - Key concepts covered
   - Learning tips
   - Related files to explore
   - Congratulatory message
